                        <div class="separator"></div>
                        <p>Everything we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on
                            our
                            natural environment. To pursue sustainability, it is necessary to create and maintain
                            conditions
                            under which the people and nature can co-exist in productive harmony to support present and
                            future
                            generations.</p>
                        <p>In order to reduce environmental footprint, energy footprint and community’s footprint, we
                            have
                            identified seven different areas where progress is achieved. These seven strands maintain a
                            dynamic
                            balance and harmonize to nature’s grand symphony.</p>
