                        <p>Tremendous amount of energy is gathered around the Agnihotra copper pyramid just at Agnihotra time. A magnetic-type field is created, which neutralizes negative energies and reinforces positive energies. – Jaya Prakash, Architect, Vaastu & Energy Expert – FHD Group</p>

                        <p>Human beings have created problems for themselves with their irresponsible greed for more by looting natural resources and destroying the environment. Our living spaces have become sources of imbalance which then translate into physical, mental and spiritual ill being of its residents.</p>

                        <p>At Organo, we practise Agnihotra, a simple healing fire (Homa) taken from the ancient Vedic sciences of bio energy, psychotherapy, medicine, agriculture, biogenetics, climate engineering and interplanetary communication.</p>

                        <p>The process involves the usage of a copper pyramid of a fixed size to light a healing fire. Copper and gold are the only metals prescribed for the pyramid container used for Agnihotra fire which acts as an antidote for all the problems we have created for ourselves and for the whole of nature.</p>

                        <p>It is a process of purifying the atmosphere through a specially prepared fire with dried cow-dung cakes and putting some grains of rice & ghee into the fire exactly at sunrise and sunset to the accompaniment of two simple mantras. Agnihotra is tuned to the biorhythm corresponding to sunrise/sunset. Agnihotra is practised at regular intervals in Organo.</p>

                        <p>Tremendous amounts of energy is gathered around the Agnihotra copper pyramid just at Agnihotra time. A magnetic-type field is created, which neutralizes negative energies and reinforces positive energies. Therefore, a positive pattern is created by one who does Agnihotra merely by his/her performance. Agnihotra purifies the atmosphere of pollutants and neutralizes harmful radiation. The resultant atmosphere gives nourishment to plant life.</p>

                        <p>Agnihotra and Plants: The ghee is thrust into the atmosphere and attaches itself to the molecular structure of the soil, allowing the soil to retain more moisture. Plants grown in Agnihotra atmosphere are better able to withstand droughts. Agnihotra causes a change in the cellular structure of the plant which sends more nutrients to the fruit of the plant and less to the leaves, stem and roots.</p>

                        <p>Many people have found that the size, taste, texture and yield of fruits and vegetables grown in Agnihotra atmosphere are superior. Performance of Agnihotra in the garden reduces pest problems and organic gardening and farming are made easier by using Homa (healing fire) techniques.</p>

                        <p>Medicinal properties of Agnihotra: Agnihotra renews the brain cells, revitalizes the skin and purifies the blood. It is the holistic approach to life. Many people who are normally allergic to smoke experience a healing effect by sitting in Agnihotra atmosphere. The healing effects of Agnihotra are locked in the resultant ash. Thousands of people in different parts of the world have experienced wonderful healings of all types of ailments by using Agnihotra ash.</p>
