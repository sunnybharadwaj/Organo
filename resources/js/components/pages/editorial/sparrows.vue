                        <p>Remember them? Our gentle little guests! Every morning they would wake us up with a familiar tune. Perched on ledges and lofts, they would hop right inside our houses and in the balconies the whole day, full of life, taking occasional tiny bites from our leftover supper. Nesting on low branches, in our homes and in sheds, they would put a smile on our faces us no matter what. Sparrows have been an integral part of our growing up years.</p>

                        <p>Knowingly or unknowingly, they’ve been our guests who greet us every day, our family, who share our home and food, our friends who never leave us alone. Their cute and chirpy presence, once a regularity is now a rarity. Once aplenty, now it is hard to find even one in today’s urban environment. All this happened in a span of just a few years.</p>

                        <p>Sparrows were mostly seen around human habitats. Earlier constructions allowed sparrows to nest in nooks and corners, but modern-day constructions don’t have space for birds. Also, with agricultural land moving away from the city, finding food in the concrete jungle is not easy for them.</p>

                        <p>Also evidence suggests that heavy vehicular pollution and cell phone tower radiation have impacted their existence. But, the fact that these birds are still seen in the outskirts where there is less pollution and radiation, gives us hope.</p>

                        <p>Organo aims to bring back the days of the sparrow. It actively supports the concepts of miniforest and little ponds to collect rain water and divert them to small wetlands, where indigenous aquatic plants can shelter and sustain species like the sparrows. For all we know, the little fella may be back for good.</p>

                        <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – the world’s leading authority on biodiversity – estimates that in 2012 – 41% of all amphibians, 33% of all reef-building corals, 25% of all mammals and 13% of all birds are at imminent risk of extinction. Organo pledges to energize biodiversity. The sparrow is back at Organo. Come greet it, today!</p>
