                        <p>At Organo, every element of nature – air, water, earth – is harnessed, preserved and
                            nourished.</p>

                        <p>According to ayurveda, human physiology is a reflection of the laws of the universe, and the
                            more in tune our lives are with nature, the healthier we will be! Our bodies possess the
                            natural intelligence to process foods that are closest to nature, such as fresh whole grains
                            and organically-grown fruits and vegetables. This makes sense when we consider that we have
                            evolved as a species over millions of years eating whole, natural foods. It is just in the
                            last few hundred years that artificial ingredients and toxic pesticides have been introduced
                            into the food chain. It is no wonder that the incidence of cancer has exploded in the last
                            few centuries. When our bodies are thrown out of balance due to long-term exposure to toxins
                            and from living an unhealthy lifestyle, the result is cancer. According to Ayurveda, cancer
                            is one of the most extreme expressions of imbalance in the body. The social and long-term
                            cure for cancer is cleaning up our environment and food chain. The increasing incidences of
                            Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Fatigue, Obesity are all the results of consuming compromised and
                            adulterated food. As we sow, so we reap. When we toxify our mother earth, the result is that
                            our bodies become toxic.</p>

                        <p>Organo understands fully well that the only route to good health is to choose organic,
                            unprocessed foods. At Organo, every element of nature – air, water, earth – is harnessed,
                            preserved and nourished. Methods like Tunnel Drafting and Energy Modelling are implemented
                            in an endeavour to maintain ecological balance. Organic farming is a way of life here. The
                            vegetables, fruits and herbs grown organically ensure good health of the Naandians.</p>
