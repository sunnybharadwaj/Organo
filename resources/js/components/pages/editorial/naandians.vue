                            milk. Apart from this, they engage in nature’s bounty with serene pockets of mini forests,

                            life.</p>

                        <p>A new-age urban community driven passionately by the ethos of “agro-culture and sustainable
                            organic farming”, Organo has developed India’s Largest collective Organic Farming Community.
                            Thriving on the concept of ‘farm-to-table’, Organo offers its residents the best of both
                            worlds – an urban lifestyle entrenched with the finer nuances of a rural life. The community
                            uses the best of technology and nature for effective and productive organic farming.
                            Organo is for those who are looking for an alternative urban, self-sustainable and healthy
                            lifestyle, which respects nature and its resources without compromising on their comforts
                            and conveniences. In other words, it is a community where residents live a life connected to
                            the nature.</p>

                        <p>Spread across 35-acres in the lush green bio-conservation zone of Hyderabad – 9 kms. from
                            APPA Junction on the Himayath Sagar – Chevella Road, it is for those who respect nature’s
                            ways and want to lead a life of selfreliance through a completely sustainable organic way of
                            living.</p>

                        <p>It has been designed as aholistic farm, where farming It features community farming, personal
                            farming,nursery, animal husbandry,forest plantation, medicinal plantation, aqua farming, api
                            culture etc. Apart from a 16.5-acres community farm dedicated to various fruits and
                            vegetables, every resident will have open spaces in their own farm plot to indulge in their
                            choice of vegetables and fruits. Together, all these greatly benefit the residents in
                            leading a sustainable and healthy lifestyle.</p>

                        <p>A lot of research and detailing has gone into the design of the project to ensure that it is
                            viable and appropriate for the residents in every which way. A group of passionate
                            architects, organic farming professionals, organic product makers and other experts from
                            diverse and related fields have come together to make Organo a pioneering model that will
                            inspire a whole generation to shift to the organic way of life. It is an earnest attempt to
                            re-establish connection with the lost thread of value systems, indigenous knowledge and
                            technologies native to our land and harmonizing it to today’s necessities. This should be
                            the start of a change that will help in conservation and enhancement of ecology in the
                            surroundings and may be even further, in days to come. It’s all about Pooling!
                            It is a farmer’s community that shares farming related infrastructure while enjoying the
                            fruits of collective living. The profits of the farms are divided among its members.
                            Collective farming has been successful where it is adopted as a choice in several
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>At Organo, we explore innovative organic farming methods by employing farming experts, to
                            maximize the efficiency and effectiveness, in addition to enhancing the health of our
                            community and the soil.</p>

                        <p>Knowledge systems: We have all gone through those phases when we wanted to become farmers or
                            meddle with our home technologies to just run appliances with solar power. But, the
                            maintenance, upkeep, the research time required for being able to do it is not our everyday
                            luxury. Organo solves this with expert care for every indulgence to become self-sustainable.
                            Grid- free power: To be self-reliable for energy needs is a far off aspiration even for
                            major corporations as the sheer scale involved to be able to do that makes it impractical.
                            This can be solved when more than 50 families come together – a microgrid, sharing power
                            with a backup as the grid power can be established.</p>

                        <p>Water security: Water is a commodity that is a regional resource. Water management techniques
                            like Rain Water Conservation work efficiently only when applied to a large parcel of
                            land.</p>

                        <p>Labour management: One of the missions of Organo is to create a secondary income source for
                            farmers and create employment plus skill development in surrounding villages, which give an
                            opportunity to have ample work force to maintain Naandi.</p>

                        <p>Security: No amount of high-tech security measures can render the same peace of mind that a
                            group of families living together can provide. A sense of belonging to a group provides
                            reassurance to all.</p>
